# Sponsor

This project is maintained by Francisco Presencia and is part of Francisco IO LTD (UK). It is a lot of work and I'd love if you or your company could help me keep building it and in the process I'll help you with Node.js.

**All sponsors will receive an ebook and/or a book** for free when released. Besides this, there are some sponsors tiers:


| sponsorship  | perk                           | credit (homepage + github)   |
